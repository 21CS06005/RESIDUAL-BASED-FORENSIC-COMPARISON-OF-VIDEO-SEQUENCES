# Comparing two video sequences
**_RESIDUAL-BASED-FORENSIC-COMPARISON-OF-VIDEO-SEQUENCES_**

# Pre-requisite
-   Git-Hub account
-   Python 3
-   pip

# Inputs
  -   **Original video filename** - This takes the name of the file alongwith the extension where the original video sequence is stored. 
  -   **Tempered video filename** - This takes the name of the file alongwith the extension where the tempered video sequence is stored. 

Upload the files in the local storage before running the program.

  - Step-2 Once open, run all the cells from the beginning.
  - Step-3 Finally run the **result** segment to see the results. The difference between the frames of Original and Tempered videos. As well as the Mahalanobis distance of both videos.
